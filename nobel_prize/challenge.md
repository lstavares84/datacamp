Task 1: Instructions
Load the required libraries and the Nobel Prize dataset.

Import the pandas library as pd.
Import the seaborn library as sns.
Import the numpy library as np.
Use pd.read_csv to read in datasets/nobel.csv and save it into nobel.
Show at least the first six entries of nobel using the head() method, setting n=6 or greater.
Good to know
Note: a test in this task relies on the expected last output of this cell. In this case, the first six entries of nobel being displayed. If this is not the case, you may run into the following error after ten seconds of the cell being processed: "Your code exceeded the maximum run time permitted."

This project assumes you are familiar with the pandas and seaborn libraries and before taking on this project, we recommend that you have completed the courses Data Manipulation with pandas and Intermediate Data Visualization with Seaborn.

Two cheat sheets that will be useful throughout this project: DataCamp's Seaborn cheat sheet and Data Wrangling with pandas cheat sheet. We recommend that you keep them open in separate tabs to make it easy to refer to them.
